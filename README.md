Repo 10 of a collection of repos, containing the random python and pygame projects I've worked on

The level creator for the breakout game. Has a GUI to create levels quickly, which then encodes and saves levels in a txt file. However I never got arround to fully integrating the 2 programs, so
files need to be manually transferred, along with some altering of the main game code to use new levels.
